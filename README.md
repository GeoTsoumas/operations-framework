## What to expect here

### Planning and Execution in Public
This is a community contribution to blockchain-driven communities.
We're operating in the public and share our expertise in Business Operations with the wider public.
You can also join our GitBook which is more focusing on the concept work.
We are proud to be supported with as Opensource project by the [GitBook Team](https://gitbook.io). ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Blueprints
We are building non-intrusive transparency frameworks for communities in public.

### Documentation for Catalyst funds
The European Cardano Community received funds for its operation during Cardano Catalyst Fund 10.
Thus we are documenting our workload and milestones here.

### Fireside chat / EU Town Hall slides
We host regular Fireside Chats / Town Halls every second Thursday. 
Feel invited to join as a speaker, too üëâ[Learn more](https://github.com/eucardano/brandassets/blob/main/templates/yt-description-socials.md)  
While we record those events and publish the videos on YouTube, we will also add a copy of the slides we prepared for the presentation
here for you to look over and as a quick reference.


### Software or scripts
We may write simple scripts to automate tasks. In case those may be useful to somebody else, we
will add them in our public repositories.

## How this all started?
Several regional communities were operating in the Cardano Ecosystem in 2022. However, a community focussing on European specific aspects (e.g. regulatory framework, localization for European languagues) was not in place.

In alignment with the Catalyst Swarm project, and with support from the LATAM Cardano Community, the EU Cardano Discord Channel was created on July 7th 2022.

A twitter (now X) account followed and step by step, the EU Cardano Community started taking shape.

## Our purpose

In the spirit of the broader Cardano Ecosystem, we started onboarding team members who identify themselves both with the Cardano vision, and with the European region. As the EU Cardano Community, we are apolitical and our goal is to connect people. Not only people living in Europe, but anyone interested in connecting with the region, and expanding the Cardano values all over the world.

The exchange of ideas, vision and project with all other regional communities (aka Town Halls) is part of our purpose.
