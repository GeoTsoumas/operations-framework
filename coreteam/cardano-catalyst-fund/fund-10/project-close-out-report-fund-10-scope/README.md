### List of challenge KPIs

* Grow the ADA economy and inform our future funding priorities.
* It’s all about exploring the gaps where Catalyst innovation funding hasn’t reached yet.
* Explain how your project will benefit the Cardano ecosystem

We connected new people to Cardano by reaching out beyond our ecosystem, including former SEC lawyers and other blockchain projects like Partisia, Matic, Meld, and Nervos. \
**Target:** Promote the idea of an open, sincere, and friendly Cardano ecosystem.\
**Results:** Projects joining our community trust that we are welcoming them while providing valuable conversations.

We planted the seeds to build a Global Donation Framework, and added Cardano core influencers and members to a signing committee including Hoskytoken, Tobler, and most of the Cardano TownHalls.\
**Target:** Promote the idea to jointly create a framework for a safer and more transparent donation process.\
**Results:** Through our online event we kickstarted the framework. Results have been very low for now.

We are probably best known to foster communication amongst founders through our fortnightly fireside chats. \
**Target:** Provide a virtual communication Hub to share views and impacts from a European perspective.\
**Results:** We are growing into a founder-centric community that promotes inclusivity and opportunities to create connections and exchange founder-relevant information through conversations.

### List of project KPIs

* sign-ups via Discord invites or other measurable links
* number of project profiles in the EuCardano Discord
* Avg users attending our spaces / TH
* retweets of recordings after a YT publication
* activity on GitHub for research projects
* number of endorsements of participants/companies

### Update of KPI

The following table shows the tracking of our KPI for the Fund 10 proposal timeframe.&#x20;

Given the difficult market conditions, the growth of the community is noticeable and is reflected in the KPI. We highlighted those values in "green" (column "Goal") which were met according to the planning when submitting the proposal.&#x20;

In the case of the number of participants in the Zoom calls, we didn't quite reach the target value. The teams is continuously evaluating ideas in order to increase the interest of the community and their participation in our online events.&#x20;

Main area of focus going forward is the usage of Discord and the engagement there. As reflected in the numbers, we did not reach the desired level of activity there.

Collaborations between founders and people wanting to learn about the different projects will be key to continue developing our community in upcoming months.&#x20;

Note that the remaining funds (last payout after closeout) - will be used to bridge the timeframe for operations until Fund 11 becomes active. A carry over by categories will be respected, so that planned budgets per category are not exceeded.

### Summary and THANK you #CardanoCommunity

Huge thanks to our Cardano family! Even though the market has been like a rollercoaster, your spirit and support have really shined, helping our community blossom. \
We stumbled a bit to meet our Zoom and Discord goals to the fullest, but seeing so many of you jump into our YouTube events and X-Spaces always feels like a warm homecoming. \
We have created a spot where founders meet and talk casually about their projects and what moves them, which leaves us proudly humbled to be part of our team and the whole movement around blockchain, especially within Cardano.\
It's the coming together, the sharing of dreams and knowledge, that truly sparks joy in our hearts.

We're now setting our sights on making in-person events and our Discord a buzzing place of connection and planning more collaborations that remind us of the vibrant gatherings back home. The insights from our financial tracking and all those digital get-togethers are our guiding stars for the journey ahead.

So, here's a big shout out to you, our Cardano community, for being such an incredible force. Thanks a million for riding this wave with us. Let's keep this spirit alive and kick some goals together!

\
Your sincerely, \
\


The Admin Team of @EUCardano&#x20;
