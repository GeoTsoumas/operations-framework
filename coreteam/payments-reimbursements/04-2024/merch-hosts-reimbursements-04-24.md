* as we are currently short on team members participating, we have shifted the priorities to organize hosts for the country hubs. Reason for this is, that we believe the distribution of merch will be much easier to accomplish than getting hosts ready to participate. During Milestone 2 in April, we have created a budgeting plan for the workshop merch and are working on the design in Milestone 2 as well.
* design will most likely be made directly by the team as communication time and execution costs wouldn't be efficient in comparison of make vs. buy
* we are also evaluating the option for a Discord bot, that would help our Discord users to distribute their channel communication across multiple servers. We see this as a digital asset. Pricing for development and hosting is still in negotiation. But we calculate around 250EUR development costs, with a monthly hosting price of 20-40EUR for the first 400 projects/servers.
* We kindly ask to distribute the full completion of this PoA to the second milestone with a potential overflow into the third. Reasoning for overflow into third milestone are development time and the activities around Fund12. We want to utilize some of the attention campaigns from projects to foster the distribution of merch.
