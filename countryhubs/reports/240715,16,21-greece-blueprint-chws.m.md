2. **Audience Familiarity with Blockchain and Crypto**:  
   The Greek public is interested in blockchain technology. It is also very receptive to Cardano's research based approach, especially because two major Athenian universities are part of IOG’s research program. But, because of lack of 
   awareness and knowledge sources in Greek, many of them had not heard of Cardano before the workshops. Also, they had no prior knowledge about the fundamentals of blockchain technology

  The attendees had a mixed professional and educational background, including a journalist,a public official working for the Greek securities exchange bureau, an IT security specialist and a Zero Knowledge researcher. It also included 
   some founding members of a highly active DAO, founded on a different blockchain. Hence, there were many potentional founders that used the workshop as an opportunity to expant their knowledge and network.

5. **Business Topics Covered**:  
   Our workshops’ goals were to educate the attendees about what blockchain technology is, and what it has to offer from an economical and entrepreneurial point of view, and demonstrate how a user can create and use a non custodial wallet 
   to interact with dApps.Overall, the attendees gain a significant amount of knowledge about blockchain technology and its use cases as a whole, and especially Cardano. The attendees that were crypto beginners had a change in their beliefs about crypto.
