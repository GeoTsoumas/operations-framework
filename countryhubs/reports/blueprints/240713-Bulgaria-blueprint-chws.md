### Learnings on Business or Funding Related Topics

The main theme surrounding the topics mentioned above was that establishing a company provides a formal structure for business operations, which is essential for legal, financial, and organizational purposes.

We covered why people need a company if they want to offer a product or a service. The reasons we touched about that topic was:
1. Legal Protection – People may need to create a company to protect the founders of a product or a service. One of the most important protection that a company can provide is the separation of personal assets from business assets or liabilities for that matter. The second protection reason that emerged from the tasks during the Workshop was that the founders are protected during a partnership with other companies for products or services. If from one side of the deal there are people not binded by a company, most of the benefits of the deal will be for the other side of the deal that is actaul company.
2. Financial Management – When having a company it is easier to secure funding for projects, especially when there are more than 1 founder in the company. One of the reasons is that if 2 or more people are ok to work towards creating something valuable and not just 1 person, that means that probably the idea of the product or the service is somewhat valuable and thus the bank or the investor can be more sure that there is less risk when providing the funding.
3. Brand and Market Presence – In regarding to the branding we agreed that a particular brand Is associated with positive or negative deeds, activities or attachements. So by creating a positive associated brand makes the founders and the business more credible and trustworthy among customers and stakeholders.
About the topic “Basic accounting needs within Web3.0 environment.” The discussion got a bit more deep, because one of the participants has an accounting firm and he was not that familiar with the web3 environment but he was well informed how are the things in accounting done in the traditional/legacy company world. The result of the discussion was that the regulations are somewhat clearer with the MicA document but nevertheless specially in Bulgaria, a law can be read in 2-3 and more different ways…
…So the result was especially in Bulgaria that people need to have:
1. A very good accountant who is constantly reading and understanding web3 type technologies,
2. A very good lawyer also learning constantly about web3 and the laws surrounding the narrative,
3. A trustworhty bank consultant with a bank that is embracing the new way of doing things through web 3, crypto and blockchain technologies.
And these 3 or more people have to work together and communicating all the time for the founders of the company to be sure that they will not have big problems with this side of their business.
4. (the most important about Bulgaria) Have very good connections in high places: ministeries, government, powerfull businesses, courts and local manicipality people.

My toughts: I think the above mentioned 4 points could be benefitial in all European countries not only in Bulgaria.
We also briefly touched on the areas where blockchain technology can perform better for the businesses. Cardano in particular. About this topic I pointed out during the WS the 2 more possibilites for funding a company or a business idea for creating a valuable product or delivering a valuable service, and that was creating and selling NFTs and thus providing the funds/fuel for your business and the other option which is mostly familiar within the Cardano communities – Proposing a ballot/proposal in the Catalyst platform. 
Here the interest of the participants sparkled! They did not know about these options and that engaged them a lot. 2 projects emerged from the WS and after the discussion about the funding options in web3, Cardano ecosystem. The work for these projects already began!

Regarding the topic “Marketing within the Web3.0 environment”.
The discussion was around credibility and trustworthy of the projects. Here I, as a specialyst in the industry pointed out the complete transparancy of the projects provided by the founders of the company/business through platforms like Discord, Cardanospot, YouTube, LinkedIN… etc…
Showcasing already completed work and devotion around the project.

Unfortunately we didn’t have the time to cover everything from the original plan due to the heated discussions that emerged from the topics. All of the participants are eager to attend to a second WS to continue with the topics. We are planning to organize a 2nd WS in the following 2 months.
